## suru-watermonitor adapter for ioBroker

Reads data of the SURU WaterMonitor water meter / pipe monitor from the SURU cloud.
The cloud API is not public and was reverse engineered, see also the
[Home Assistant integration](https://github.com/teuffel/homeassistant-suru-watermonitor) this adapter is ported from.

### Configuration

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| E-Mail / Password | Credentials of your SURU account (the same as in the SURU app). The password is stored encrypted. |
| Poll interval | Minutes between cloud requests, 5 to 1440 (default 60). |

### States

One device is created per unit on the account (`suru-watermonitor.0.<unitId>.*`):

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `meterReading` | Meter reading in m³ |
| `consumptionToday` | Consumption since 00:00 UTC in l |
| `waterHardness` | Water hardness in °dH |
| `phValue` | pH value |
| `lastMeasured` | Timestamp of the last measurement |
| `alarm` | `true` if the pipe monitor reports an active alarm or incident |
| `activeIncidents` | JSON array of active incident types (`highFlow`, `continuousWaterFlow`, `temperature`, `lowFlow`) |

`info.connection` shows whether the last cloud request succeeded.
